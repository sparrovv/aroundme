# Around Me

## The problem

Have you ever wondered if a location that you are looking for is a good place to live / rent / buy?

What are the facilities around it? Are there any good restaurants, schools, parks, etc.?
What's the quality of the air? And is it close to public transportation?

### The solution

Around Me is a service that will help you get an idea of the location you are looking for.
It will provide you with a score based on close by facilities and the distance to them.
